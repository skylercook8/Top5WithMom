Lots of good memories with my mom come from those cheer competitions becuase she came to every single one, except for when she was pregnant with my brother. My mom always cheered me on and made sure she was in the front to see me and they are such special memories!</p>

                        <p class="lead">My mom always books family trips to the beach, but during the off seasons so its cheaper and less crowded. This trip, we were in Nags Head during Christmas and the water was freezing, but my mom and I wanted to hop in SO BAD. To do this, we rented wet suits and swam in the ocean and it was so different, something we've never done before, and such a good time!</p>

We had gave up on asking until that cutie little yorkie showed up on my moms Facebook page. We decided he needed to be ours and we would ask for forguvness instead of permission this time. My dad actually loves the dog and we are so happy we decided to sneak him home.</p>
